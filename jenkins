#Jenkins

##What is Jenkins?

Jenkins is an open-source automation tool is created using Java
programming language. For the initial setup, it facilitates users with
CI/CD (continuous integration (CI) or continuous delivery) technique
that simplifies the use and management of processes.

This figure represents the complete flow: from the build to the test a
job or a pipeline.

##Jenkins plugins:

Jenkins plugins work by creating or extending an extension point, which
hooks into a specific part of the build process.

The plugins configuration is usually stored in the form of an XML file
located inside the \$JENKINS_HOME root, which defines the structure and
settings that are mandatory for each plugin.

A new Jenkins item can be a job or a pipeline, so we can create project
that can Jenkins build for us.

We have two kinds of pipelines: declarative pipeline and scripted
pipeline.
